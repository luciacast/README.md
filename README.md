### **Hi there!** 

#### About me:
I'm 19 and a beginner in programming.   
It all started when I received a scholarship to study basic **frontend** last year (2022) and I fell in love with it!
  
I'm currently focused on learning programming languages. I started with JavaScript, and then I received another scholarship to study Java.   
I'm on it at the moment, and it's going great. 

I'm from Argentina and I speak Spanish and English :)

I'm also studying Digital Journalism *(Tec. Universitaria en Periodismo Digital)* at Universidad Nacional de Mar del Plata.
